# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Amazon-bestsellers-Using-Python
I took a deep dive into the Amazon bestseller books. This is the scenario: You are a data analyst at Amazon and your manager has asked you to explore and analyze some data. She has provided some questions she would like to be answered.
Below are some of the questions and their answers.

1. Are there any missing data?
ANS: No, there are no missing data. 

2. Are there any duplicates?
ANS: Yes, there were duplicates. 

3. Are there any spelling errors in the name column?
ANS: Yes, there were spelling errors in the name column. 

4. Are there any outliers?
ANS: Yes, there was only one outlier. I used the boxplot method to identify the outlier.

The remaining questions are the charts/visualizations.

I used Microsoft **Power Bi** to visualize some of the insights.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
ðŸ“Œ Encourage more Reviews: Good reviews play a significant role in the success of a book. They should encourage more customers to leave reviews by offering incentives such as gift cards, discounts, or freebies. To encourage customers to review books, also try reaching out to book bloggers and other influencers who can help draw attention to top-rated books.

ðŸ“Œ Host Book Events: To boost book sales, Amazon could host book events where readers can meet and interact with their favorite authors. Book signings, readings, and Q&A sessions help to promote books and authors, creating an excellent marketing opportunity. Hosting such events would attract book lovers and provide an additional channel to generate revenue by selling books at the venue.
